Some code to read ccs811 co2 sensor

* Building
- Install CCS811 arduino library for Arduino IDE.
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CCS811

- Compile
- Upload
- Profit
After each restart, the sensor needs 20 minutes to stabilize.

Also there is a few days of burn in period after boxing, when the values are unusable. You need to be very patient ...

* Read data from serial
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python3 -m pip install hy pyserial
hy ccs811-save-data.hy --serial /dev/ttyACM0 --logs /var/log/ccs811
#+END_SRC

* Read the sensor directly using raspberry pi2.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python3 ccs811-sensor-rpi2.py
#+END_SRC
